            We aim is to drive the zero waste to landfill agenda. SA however, is
            a dynamic and a rather economically stagnant country, with a lot of
            informal economy. Recycling has been such an economy, with the
            greatest number of reclaimers situated in and around the townships
            and informal settlements around the landfills. This has enabled
            private sector to access recyclable material with a degree of ease
            and provided a much needed source of income to the many reclaimers.
